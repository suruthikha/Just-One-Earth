<h1 align="center"><B><br>Virginia, USA - Trash cans near 'Watersheds' in communities.<br></h1>

 <p align="center"><br>Our project is to protect watersheds in our community. In order to prevent watersheds from being clogged by trash such as plastic bags, we would like to put trash cans around the watersheds for people to put their trash without littering. After removing the plastic and the blockers in the watershed that collected there after a rain, we should put them in the trash cans. The trash cans should be emptied weekly. </p>
 
 <h3 align="left"><B>Importance of Watersheds:</h3>  
 
  <p align="left"><br>A watershed is an area of land where all the rain water and the snow that is on it drains to the same water-body.  Some communities like ours have watersheds where the rain water from the community drains in before draining to  a river or bay.  A healthy watershed conserves water, promotes stream flow,  supports sustainable streams, rivers, lakes and groundwater sources, enables healthy soil for crops, and livestock, and also provides habitat for wildlife and plants. (<a href="http://watershedcheckup.ca">http://watershedcheckup.ca</a>) </p>
 
  <h3 align="left"><B>Problem:</h3>  
  
  <p align="left"><br>As per definition, every piece of land, road, and roof in our community is a part of watershed, but for the purpose of this article, I am treating the physical region where the rain water from our community collects or the storm water management facility  as a watershed. The watershed in our community feeds into the Chesapeake Bay.  Due to incessant rains,  lot of water collected in the watershed, but unlike before  it did not flow away.  It took authorities three days to pump,  clear the block, and have the water flow normally. Even though the water logging did lead  some beavers and ducks to have fun, the reason for water logging needs to be studied. </p>
  
  <h3 align="left"><B>Questions:</h3>  
   
   <p align="left"><br>Could it be due to the sticks, leaves, and mud that came along with the rain water?</p>
   <p align="left"><br>Could it be due to plastic trash that seem to collect there after heavy rain? </p>
   
  <h3 align="left"><B>Solution:</h3>  
	
	<p align="left"><br>Keeping a trash can near the community watershed will allow inspired members of the community to throw the trash they come across in the watershed, into it.  They do not have to carry the trash to their homes for discarding. The trash collected can be disposed along with the community's trash.</p>
	
	
  <h3 align="left"><B>Problems caused by our Solution (or) Issues that need to be addressed to have the best solution:</h3>  
	 
	 <p align="left"><br>How is the trash collected? Are plastic bags being used? Is there an alternative?</p>
	 <p align="left"><br>Whom should I approach with our solution? Should I approach the association in charge to have a trash can installed? </p>
	 
  <h3 align="left"><B>Further Research:</h3>  
	  
	  <p align="left"><br>Studying the health of the watershed by studying the benthic macro invertebrates that live there. Pollutants in the runoff that reach the watershed/storm water management facility determines the kind of organisms that live there. Studying those animals will show whether a watershed is healthy or not.</p>
